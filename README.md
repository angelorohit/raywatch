RayWatch is a simple RayTracer written in OS-Portable C++, for educational purposes.

It uses the SDL library for loading images. You will need SDL (http://www.libsdl.org/) and SDL Image (http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/) to build the source.

#####Currently implemented features:#####
* Simple backward ray tracing
