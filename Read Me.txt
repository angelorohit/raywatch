
RayWatch (http://sourceforge.net/projects/raywatch/) is a simple cross-platform
RayTracer written in C++, for educational purposes.

It uses the SDL library (http://www.libsdl.org/) for loading images.

Currently implemented features:
-> Simple backward ray tracing
-> Basic primitives: Quad, Triangle, Sphere
-> Reflection and Fuzzy Reflection
-> Refraction with Beer's Law
-> Phong Illumination Model
-> Point Lights
-> Rectangular and Spherical Area Lights
-> Texture Mapping for Quads and Spheres
-> Loading/Saving Scene data from/to file (TODO: serialization support for textures is pending)

Planned features:
-> Texture Mapping for Triangles
-> Spatial Subdivision for improving performance
-> ...

RayWatch is right now heavily Work In Progress.
